## Objective

The new covid-era has provided a new way of living the work-life balance. We have seen a lot of different websites providing packages to work from different locations. From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, from Gujarat to Assam we have collected packages in and around India. It becomes really difficult to find the best place with all the amenities such as high-speed internet, a comfortable stay as well as within the budget. To solve the real-world problem of finding the best deals for a calm and enjoying workation trip.

In this competition, one has to use the knowledge of machine learning, deep learning, and model building to predict the price per person for your next workstation trip.

## Data Collection

I have sourced the dataset from "Machine Hack Gen AI" website.

This dataset contains 30k records of previous workation trip prices

## Preprocessing

- Removed redundant variables.
- Extracted numerical insights from text data.
- Created new features with date variable.
- Cleaned the data with help of RegEx (Regular Expression).
- Encoded the categorical variables.

## Learnings

- Learned how to extract data from date variable.
- Learned basic overview of Regular Expression.
- Code simplification.

## Model

- Did hyperparameter tuning and got best minimum error by Random Forest Regressor.
